Meet &micro;Framework
===============

&micro;Framework is **your** micro-framework, the one you are going to build in
the next practicals. Its API is heavily inspired by existing micro-frameworks
such as [Silex](http://silex.sensiolabs.org) or
[Slim](http://www.slimframework.com).


Getting Started
---------------

Get [the
code](https://raw.github.com/willdurand-edu/php-practicals/master/files/ufw.tgz):

    $ wget https://raw.github.com/willdurand-edu/php-practicals/master/files/ufw.tgz -O $DOCROOT/projects/uframework/ufw.tgz
    $ cd $DOCROOT/projects/uframework
    $ tar xvzf ufw.tgz
    $ rm !$

### PHPUnit

[PHPUnit](http://phpunit.de) is a PHP testing framework part of the _xUnit_
family. To install it globally in the virtual machine, run:

    vagrant@vm $ wget http://pear.phpunit.de/get/phpunit.phar
    vagrant@vm $ chmod a+x phpunit.phar
    vagrant@vm $ sudo mv phpunit.phar /usr/bin/phpunit

Run a test suite using the following command:

    vagrant@vm $ phpunit


Anatomy of &micro;Framework
---------------------


The directory layout looks like this:

    ├ app/      # the application directory
    ├ src/      # the framework sources
    ├ tests/    # the test suite
    ├ web/      # public directory
    └ autoload.php

### `app` directory

Your application controllers will be registered as closures in `app.php`.
Templates will be put into the `templates/` directory.

### `src` directory

The framework sources. You will have to complete the missing parts.

### `tests` directory

The test suite, all tests have to pass at the end :)

### `web` directory

Contains the public files. Most of the time, we put assets (CSS, JS files)
and a `index.php` file.

The `index.php` file is the only entry point of your application.  It is called
a **front controller**.


Autoloading
-----------

In the previous practical, you wrote a PSR-0 compliant autoloader. The
&micro;Framework has a `autoload.php` file, but it iss empty.

**Fix it!**

Run the test suite to ensure everything works:

    vagrant@vm-licpro $ phpunit

Cool. See you next week!
